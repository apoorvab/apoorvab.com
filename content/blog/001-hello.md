I finally made my own personal website after many years of redirecting my domain directly to LinkedIn.

Glad I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to leverage in order to make this. Also, I used [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) for the social icons on the About page.

Currently using the [Hugo Basic Theme](https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic) which is simple enough to give me what I want. I will be testing out the projects feature next!
