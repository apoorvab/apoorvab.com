Hello, I'm Apoorva - a motorcycle riding video game developer currently working with Sucker Punch Productions.

I do my best to disprove the following comment from [Alain De Botton](https://www.alaindebotton.com/):

> *Work finally begins when the fear of doing nothing exeeds the fear of doing it badly.*

This is my personal website where I host my public musings and projects. Hopefully a compelling personal counterargument to the above.
